# 🎄 Advent of Code 2024 Solutions 🎄

Welcome to my **Advent of Code 2024** repository! This is where I document my solutions to the daily programming challenges from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024), a yearly coding event that runs throughout December.

## 📝 About
Advent of Code is a series of small daily puzzles that grow in complexity over the month. It’s a fun way to:
- Sharpen problem-solving skills.
- Explore new programming techniques.
- Enjoy coding during the festive season!

All solutions here are implemented in **Python**.

## 📂 Repository Structure
The repository is organized by day, with each day having its own folder:

```plaintext
Day 1/
├── example.txt       # Example input provided by the puzzle description
├── input.txt         # Full puzzle input for the day
├── Part_1.py         # Solution for Part 1 of the puzzle
├── Part_2.py         # Solution for Part 2 of the puzzle
Day 2/
├── example.txt
├── input.txt
├── Part_1.py
├── Part_2.py
├── Help/             # (Optional) Additional test cases or edge cases
│   ├── edge_case.txt
│   ├── example_2.txt
    
...
```


Each folder contains:
- `example.txt`: The test case provided in the puzzle description.
- `input.txt`: The actual input for the puzzle.
- `Part_1.py`: My solution for Part 1.
- `Part_2.py`: My solution for Part 2.
- `Help/`: (optional): Contains additional test cases or edge cases for debugging and validating solutions.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AlexanderLu98/AdventOfCode.git
   
2. Navigate to the folder of the day you want to run:
   ```bash
   cd "Day 1"

4. Execute the solution script for Part 1 or Part 2:
   ```bash
    python Part_1.py
    python Part_2.py
